  specific design principle, that you would like to follow?
* Describe the system that attempts to solve the problem on a high level as an
  agent.
    - What is the working environment of the agent? Use the Russell & Norvig's
      [PEAS categories](topics1.en.md)
    - What kinds of observations the agent can make of its environment, what is
      the available information? Is the information precise or is there
      uncertainty involved?
    - What kinds of actions can the agent take, and what kinds of changes it can
      effect in its environment?
    - Describe in your analysis the task environment and complexity also using
      the [dimensions](topics1.en.md) described in the material, as appropriate.
    - What kinds of strategies the agent could employ in order to come up with
      reasonable actions based on the available information?
* Choose a name for your project/agent. It can be the same as the group's name.

Remember, that the work on the project takes place iteratively during the whole
duration of the course. In each phase, the most important thing is to quickly
come up with some reasonable, preliminary content. It is possible to keep
improving each week's results during the following weeks and before handing in
the final project report.
