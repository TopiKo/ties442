## Task 1

What kinds of things you expect to learn during this course? What kinds of
artificial intelligence applications you wish to be able to develop after this
course? What kinds of applications would you like to learn to develop during the
next ten years after the course?

# Answer
I expect to learn what is the state of machine learning at the moment, what kind of approaches has people developed and how well these approaches perform. I would like to undestand the challenges related to learning systems. I am also interested in the concept of learning and intelligence in general. 

I would like to be able to develop simple learning program that could try to predict (after learning) human bahauviour in some simple enviroments. Example could be rock scissors paper game..

In the next ten years it would be nice to develop programs that could survive in many different enviroments by adapting to the enviroment. These machines could also share their experiences with each other and thus teach their abilities.

## Task 2

What artificial intelligence is, in your opinion? What kinds of progress you
expect to witness during the next two decades? Find some example of an
application of artificial intelligence that you find impressive, and discuss in
what ways artificial intelligences will improve in performing that task.

Log here the places where you looked for the example, the address where you
learned about the example and any revelations you experienced during the search.



## Task 3

Let us consider agents as entities that act autonomously. What kinds of
requirements an entity has to fulfill in order to be called an agent? Search
from the web definitions of intelligent or autonomous agents, and invent your
own. A good starting point is Wikipedia and web pages of various artificial
intelligence courses.

Log here addresses of websites you found and describe briefly what you learned
from each.

## Task 4

What kind of agent can be called rational? What rationality means in your
opinion? How rational humans are in your opinion? Could an artificial agent be
more rational?

## Task 5

What intelligence means in your opinion? What kind of agent can be called
intelligent? How intelligent humans are in your opinion? Could an artificial
agent be more intelligent?

## Task 6

In your opinion, are there tasks that artificial intelligences or agents will
never be able to perform? Reason about your claim.
