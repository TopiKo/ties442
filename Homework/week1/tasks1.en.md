## Task 1

What kinds of things you expect to learn during this course? What kinds of
artificial intelligence applications you wish to be able to develop after this
course? What kinds of applications would you like to learn to develop during the
next ten years after the course?

### Answer
I expect to learn what is the state of machine learning at the moment, what kind of approaches has people developed and how well these approaches perform. I would like to undestand the challenges related to learning systems. I am also interested in the concept of learning and intelligence in general. 

I would like to be able to develop simple learning program that could try to predict (after learning) human bahauviour in some simple enviroments. Example could be rock scissors paper game..

In the next ten years it would be nice to develop programs that could survive in many different enviroments by adapting to the enviroment. These machines could also share their experiences with each other and thus teach their abilities.

## Task 2

What artificial intelligence is, in your opinion? What kinds of progress you
expect to witness during the next two decades? Find some example of an
application of artificial intelligence that you find impressive, and discuss in
what ways artificial intelligences will improve in performing that task.

Log here the places where you looked for the example, the address where you
learned about the example and any revelations you experienced during the search.

### Answer
As already discussed the definition of artificial intelligence is difficult. I could define intelligence (artificial or not) so that I regocnice intelligence when I meet it. This does not imply that passing Touring test on me a computer necessesarily is intelligent. It should also be able to play games that I at the instance invent and teach to it and other tests that I might invent.

In my definition this is not artificial intelligence, but these quad copters learn quite impressively

I could imagine that in few years we could see similar machines playing 'basketball' type games in teams, i.e. pass te ball to other teammates and having overall stradegy.


## Task 3

Let us consider agents as entities that act autonomously. What kinds of
requirements an entity has to fulfill in order to be called an agent? Search
from the web definitions of intelligent or autonomous agents, and invent your
own. A good starting point is Wikipedia and web pages of various artificial
intelligence courses.

Log here addresses of websites you found and describe briefly what you learned
from each.


### Answer
http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_3.html
"An agent is something that acts in an environment - it does something. Agents include worms, dogs, thermostats, airplanes, robots, humans, companies, and countries."


Intelligent agent:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent

"According to Nikola Kasabov[4] IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics:

-Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally
-Adapt online and in real time
-Are able to analyze itself in terms of behavior, error and success.
-Learn and improve through interaction with the environment (embodiment)
-Learn quickly from large amounts of data
-Have memory-based exemplar storage and retrieval capacities
-Have parameters to represent short and long term memory, age, forgetting, etc."

See Agents.pdf


## Task 4

What kind of agent can be called rational? What rationality means in your
opinion? How rational humans are in your opinion? Could an artificial agent be
more rational?

### Answer
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent

"A rational agent is an agent that has clear preferences, models uncertainty via expected values, and always chooses to perform the action with the optimal expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions."

For me rationality is: being able to choose the best option from given options in order to get to the goals one is persuing. 

In above definitions humans are not too rational as they might, to give one example, get angry and do actions that do not take the closer to their goals. Moreover, I do not think that many humans are aware of their goals and how to persue them. In this respect artificial agent could be much more rational.

## Task 5

What intelligence means in your opinion? What kind of agent can be called
intelligent? How intelligent humans are in your opinion? Could an artificial
agent be more intelligent?

### Answer 

See answer to q1. and q4.  

## Task 6

In your opinion, are there tasks that artificial intelligences or agents will
never be able to perform? Reason about your claim.

### Answer

Going faster than the speed of light. This is forbitten by general relativity.
